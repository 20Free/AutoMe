Responds when you're too lazy!
Our plan was to create a google chrome extention that would reply on your behalf once the user enables the extention, mainly facebook messanger. 
However we had some major issues to put everything together.
Our idea was to create a database with the chat information and gather what the user says the most and what was being asked of the user to then reply as humanly as possible.
